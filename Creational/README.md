# Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## Patterns Included

- **Builder**: `Builder/`
- **Factory**: `Factory/`
- **Prototype**: `Prototype.cpp`
- **Singleton**: `SingletonDependencyInjection.cpp`, `Multiton.cpp`

Each file or directory contains a self-contained example of the pattern.
