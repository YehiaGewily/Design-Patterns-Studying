## Structure

- **Behavioral Patterns**: Patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
- **Creational Patterns**: Patterns that provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural Patterns**: Patterns that explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- **SOLID**: Examples demonstrating the SOLID design principles.

## Building and Running

This project uses CMake. To build the project:

1.  Navigate to the project root.
2.  Create a build directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
3.  Run CMake:
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
4.  Build the project:
    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```

You can then run the generated executables for each pattern.
